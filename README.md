# WebSearchEngine-API

Implementation of different techniques used in Web Search Engine.

Classification techiniques:

1. Naive Bayes
2. K-means Clustering
3. K-Nearest Neighbor

These methods are used to find relevance of a given document to a query or retrieving a set a pages.

We also implement PageRank to rank pages according to their popularity once we find a set of pages relevant to the user.

We use Google's page rank method to rank pages which deals with spider traps and deadends.
